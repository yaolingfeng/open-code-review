- **AND** the two command strings SHALL be fully built server-side

### Requirement: Self-Diagnosing Handoff Failure

When the handoff cannot produce a resumable command pair, the panel SHALL render a structured failure that explains what happened, why it likely happened, and what the user can do about it. Failure responses from the server SHALL carry a typed reason discriminator and structured diagnostics; the panel SHALL render both. Silent fallbacks (single boolean signal with no explanation) SHALL be eliminated.

- **AND** the user SHALL be able to copy the diagnostics block as plain text for issue reports

#### Scenario: No fabricated commands on failure

- **GIVEN** any `unresumable` outcome
