# review-orchestration Specification

## Purpose
Review orchestration defines the 8-phase multi-agent code review workflow — from context discovery through reviewer spawning, discourse, and synthesis — that produces a prioritized, confidence-weighted final review.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Tech Lead Orchestration

The Tech Lead workflow SHALL use graph context when available to guide code exploration, reviewer assignment, test-gap awareness, and impact analysis. Graph context SHALL NOT be the sole basis for review findings or final verdict.

#### Scenario: Tech Lead uses graph context

- **GIVEN** graph context exists for a review session
- **WHEN** Tech Lead performs analysis
- **THEN** Tech Lead SHALL consider changed symbols, impacted files, test gaps, unsupported changed files, graph warnings, and changed-symbol precision signals
- **AND** review prioritization SHOULD be influenced by test gaps, affected flows, and symbol-level impact
- **AND** Tech Lead SHALL treat graph output as context for investigation rather than authoritative evidence

#### Scenario: Reviewer receives graph context

- **GIVEN** graph context exists for a review session
- **WHEN** reviewer tasks are spawned
- **THEN** each reviewer SHALL receive graph context
- **AND** reviewers MAY use `ocr graph query` for focused exploration
- **AND** reviewers SHALL NOT report findings solely because graph output says a node is risky

### Requirement: Requirements Context Input

The system SHALL accept requirements context flexibly, leveraging the AI agent's ability to discover and interpret requirements from any source the user provides.

#### Scenario: Flexible requirements input
- **GIVEN** user wants to provide requirements context
- **WHEN** user provides context via ANY of:
  - Inline description in the review request
  - Reference to a document path (spec, proposal, ticket, etc.)
  - Pasted text (bug report, acceptance criteria, notes)
- **THEN** the Tech Lead SHALL:
  - Recognize the intent to provide requirements
  - Read referenced documents if paths are provided
  - Capture and interpret the requirements
  - Propagate to all reviewer sub-agents

#### Scenario: Agent-driven requirements discovery
- **GIVEN** user mentions requirements exist somewhere
- **WHEN** the reference is ambiguous or incomplete
- **THEN** the Tech Lead MAY:
  - Search for likely spec/requirements files
  - Ask the user to clarify which document
  - Proceed with partial context and note the limitation

#### Scenario: No explicit requirements
- **GIVEN** user does not provide explicit requirements
- **WHEN** review is initiated
- **THEN** the system SHALL proceed using:
  - Discovered project standards
  - Best practices for the technology
  - Professional engineering judgment

---

### Requirement: Clarifying Questions and Scope Boundaries

The Tech Lead and all reviewer sub-agents SHALL surface clarifying questions about requirements ambiguity and scope boundaries, just as engineers do in real code reviews.

#### Scenario: Requirements ambiguity
- **GIVEN** requirements/specs contain ambiguous language
- **WHEN** the Tech Lead or a reviewer encounters the ambiguity
- **THEN** the reviewer SHALL:
  - Note the specific ambiguity
  - State their interpretation
  - Ask a clarifying question in the review output

#### Scenario: Scope boundary questions
- **GIVEN** a reviewer is uncertain whether something should be included or excluded
- **WHEN** the change appears to either:
  - Include functionality not explicitly required
  - Exclude functionality that might be expected
- **THEN** the reviewer SHALL surface a scope question:
  - "Should this include X?" or "Was X intentionally excluded?"
  - Provide reasoning for why this is worth clarifying

#### Scenario: Missing acceptance criteria
- **GIVEN** requirements lack clear acceptance criteria
- **WHEN** a reviewer cannot determine if a requirement is met
- **THEN** the reviewer SHALL:
  - State what acceptance criteria they would expect
  - Note whether the implementation appears reasonable
  - Flag for discussion with stakeholders

#### Scenario: Edge case uncertainty
- **GIVEN** requirements do not specify edge case behavior
- **WHEN** a reviewer identifies unhandled edge cases
- **THEN** the reviewer SHALL:
  - List the edge cases
  - Ask whether they should be handled
  - Suggest how they might be handled if implemented

#### Scenario: Clarifying questions in synthesis
- **GIVEN** reviewers raised clarifying questions
- **WHEN** final synthesis is generated
- **THEN** the synthesis SHALL include a "Clarifying Questions" section:
  - Questions about requirements ambiguity
  - Questions about scope boundaries
  - Questions about edge cases
  - These SHALL be surfaced prominently for stakeholder response

---

### Requirement: Natural Language Activation

The system SHALL auto-activate when the user asks to review code using natural language phrases.

#### Scenario: Natural language triggers
- **GIVEN** user sends a message
- **WHEN** message contains phrases like "review my code", "review this PR", "code review please", "check my changes", or "want feedback on my work"
- **THEN** the OCR skill SHALL activate and begin the review workflow

#### Scenario: No false activation
- **GIVEN** user discusses code review concepts without requesting one
- **WHEN** message is about code review theory or past reviews
- **THEN** the OCR skill SHALL NOT auto-activate

---

### Requirement: Explicit Command Activation

The system SHALL support explicit activation via the `/ocr:review` slash command with configurable options.

#### Scenario: Review staged changes (default)
- **GIVEN** user invokes `/ocr:review` without arguments
- **WHEN** staged changes exist in the repository
- **THEN** the system SHALL review the staged changes

#### Scenario: Review commit range
- **GIVEN** user invokes `/ocr:review HEAD~3..HEAD`
- **WHEN** the commit range is valid
- **THEN** the system SHALL review the specified commit range

#### Scenario: Review pull request
- **GIVEN** user invokes `/ocr:review pr 123`
- **WHEN** PR #123 exists and `gh` CLI is available
- **THEN** the system SHALL review the pull request diff

#### Scenario: Quick mode
- **GIVEN** user invokes `/ocr:review --quick`
- **WHEN** review workflow runs
- **THEN** the system SHALL skip the discourse phase

#### Scenario: Override redundancy
- **GIVEN** user invokes `/ocr:review --redundancy 3`
- **WHEN** review workflow runs
- **THEN** each reviewer SHALL run 3 times regardless of config

---

### Requirement: Reviewer Sub-Agent Spawning

The system SHALL spawn independent reviewer sub-agents using the Task tool, each receiving persona, project context, requirements, and Tech Lead guidance.

#### Scenario: Default reviewer team composition
- **GIVEN** user requests a review without specifying team composition
- **WHEN** Tech Lead spawns reviewers
- **THEN** the system SHALL spawn by default:
  - 2 Tasks for principal (principal-1, principal-2) - holistic architecture review
  - 2 Tasks for quality (quality-1, quality-2) - code quality review
- **AND** the system MAY optionally spawn based on change type:
  - 1 Task for security (security-1) - if auth/API/data changes detected
  - 1 Task for testing (testing-1) - if logic changes detected

#### Scenario: User-specified team composition
- **GIVEN** user specifies reviewer team in request
- **WHEN** user says "review with security focus" or "add testing reviewer" or similar
- **THEN** the Tech Lead SHALL adjust team composition accordingly

#### Scenario: Dynamic redundancy override
- **GIVEN** user specifies redundancy in request
- **WHEN** user says "use 3 principal reviewers" or "--redundancy 3" or similar
- **THEN** the system SHALL use the specified redundancy

#### Scenario: Reviewer independence
- **GIVEN** multiple reviewer Tasks are spawned
- **WHEN** each reviewer executes
- **THEN** reviewers SHALL NOT see each other's outputs during their review

#### Scenario: Reviewer context injection
- **GIVEN** a reviewer Task is spawned
- **WHEN** the reviewer begins work
- **THEN** the reviewer SHALL receive:
  - Static persona (from reviewers/*.md)
  - Discovered project context
  - Requirements/specs/proposal content (if provided)
  - Dynamic Tech Lead guidance
  - The diff and intent information

---

### Requirement: Codebase Exploration and Reviewer Agency

Each reviewer SHALL have full agency to explore the codebase as they see fit, determining what is relevant based on requirements, change goals, and their professional judgment—just as a real engineer would.

#### Scenario: Autonomous exploration
- **GIVEN** a reviewer is analyzing a code change
- **WHEN** the reviewer begins their review
- **THEN** the reviewer SHALL autonomously decide:
  - Which files to read beyond the diff
  - How deep to trace dependencies
  - What related code to examine
  - Whether to examine tests, configs, or documentation

#### Scenario: Requirements-driven exploration
- **GIVEN** requirements/specs have been provided
- **WHEN** the reviewer explores the codebase
- **THEN** the reviewer SHALL:
  - Identify code paths relevant to stated requirements
  - Trace implementation to verify requirements are met
  - Check edge cases implied by requirements
  - Examine related tests for requirements coverage

#### Scenario: Trace code relationships
- **GIVEN** a reviewer is analyzing a code change
- **WHEN** the reviewer evaluates the change
- **THEN** the reviewer MAY:
  - Read FULL files, not just diff hunks
  - Trace upstream (what calls this?)
  - Trace downstream (what does this call?)
  - Check patterns (how is similar code handled?)
  - Review related tests
  - Examine configuration and environment
  - Read documentation or comments

#### Scenario: Document exploration
- **GIVEN** a reviewer explores the codebase
- **WHEN** the reviewer documents findings
- **THEN** the review output SHALL include a "What I Explored" section listing:
  - Files examined and why
  - Code paths traced
  - How exploration informed findings

#### Scenario: Professional judgment
- **GIVEN** a reviewer has agency to explore
- **WHEN** the reviewer encounters something outside their persona's focus
- **THEN** the reviewer MAY:
  - Note it briefly for other reviewers
  - Flag it for discourse discussion
  - Pursue it if it impacts their area of expertise

---

### Requirement: Redundancy Aggregation

The system SHALL aggregate findings from redundant reviewer runs and assign confidence levels.

#### Scenario: Findings confirmed by redundancy
- **GIVEN** security reviewer ran with redundancy=2
- **WHEN** both security-1 and security-2 find the same issue
- **THEN** the finding SHALL be marked "Confirmed by redundancy" with very high confidence

#### Scenario: Single observation
- **GIVEN** security reviewer ran with redundancy=2
- **WHEN** only security-1 finds an issue (not security-2)
- **THEN** the finding SHALL be marked "Single observation" with lower confidence

---

### Requirement: Discourse Phase

The system SHALL facilitate a discourse phase where reviewers respond to each other's findings, unless `--quick` is specified.

#### Scenario: Discourse responses
- **GIVEN** all individual reviews are complete
- **WHEN** discourse phase runs
- **THEN** reviewers SHALL engage in natural discussion using:
  - AGREE: Endorse findings (increases confidence)
  - CHALLENGE: Push back with reasoning
  - CONNECT: Link findings across reviewers
  - SURFACE: Raise new concerns from discussion
- **AND** the discourse response types SHALL be fixed and not user-configurable

#### Scenario: Skip discourse
- **GIVEN** user specified `--quick` flag
- **WHEN** individual reviews complete
- **THEN** the system SHALL skip discourse and proceed to synthesis

---

### Requirement: Final Review Synthesis

The system SHALL synthesize individual reviews and discourse into a prioritized final review.

#### Scenario: Confidence weighting
- **GIVEN** findings from multiple sources
- **WHEN** synthesis occurs
- **THEN** findings SHALL be weighted by:
  1. Redundancy consensus (found by multiple runs)
  2. Cross-reviewer consensus (found by different reviewers)
  3. Discourse confirmation
  4. Severity

#### Scenario: Deduplication
- **GIVEN** the same issue found by multiple reviewers
- **WHEN** synthesis occurs
- **THEN** the issue SHALL appear once with sources noted

#### Scenario: Final review structure
- **GIVEN** synthesis is complete
- **WHEN** final review is generated
- **THEN** it SHALL include:
  - Summary
  - Verdict (APPROVE | REQUEST CHANGES | NEEDS DISCUSSION)
  - Must Fix (Critical/High severity)
  - Should Fix (Medium severity)
  - Consider (Low/Note severity)
  - What's Working Well
  - Discussion Notes

### Requirement: Existing Map Reference

The review workflow SHALL support natural language references to existing map artifacts, allowing the Tech Lead to use a previously-generated map as additional context when explicitly referenced by the user.

#### Scenario: Natural language map reference
- **GIVEN** user requests a review and references an existing map
- **WHEN** message contains phrases like "I've already generated a map", "use the map I created", "check the map in this session", or similar
- **THEN** the Tech Lead SHALL:
  - Check for existing map artifacts in the session's `map/` directory
  - If found: Read the latest run's `map.md` as supplementary context
  - If not found: Inform user no map exists and proceed with standard review

#### Scenario: Map as supplementary context
- **GIVEN** user has referenced an existing map
- **WHEN** Tech Lead reads the map artifacts
- **THEN** the Tech Lead MAY use the map to:
  - Gain additional understanding of changeset structure
  - Reference section groupings when summarizing changes
  - Note the map's hypotheses as background context
- **AND** the Tech Lead SHALL still perform standard investigation independently

#### Scenario: No automatic map usage
- **GIVEN** a map exists in the session
- **WHEN** user does NOT explicitly reference the map during review
- **THEN** the system SHALL NOT automatically use map artifacts
- **AND** the review SHALL proceed with standard context gathering

#### Scenario: Map and review as orthogonal tools
- **GIVEN** user runs `/ocr:review` without referencing a map
- **WHEN** the review workflow executes
- **THEN** the standard review workflow SHALL proceed unchanged:
  - Tech Lead performs initial analysis with standard context gathering
  - Reviewer sub-agents explore upstream/downstream as needed
  - No dependency on map artifacts

### Requirement: Phase 4 Reads the Resolved Team via OCR

The Tech Lead SHALL read the resolved team composition by calling `ocr team resolve --json` at the start of Phase 4, rather than parsing `default_team` from `.ocr/config.yaml` directly.

#### Scenario: Tech Lead reads team via OCR

- **GIVEN** a review enters Phase 4
- **WHEN** the Tech Lead determines which reviewers to spawn
- **THEN** the Tech Lead SHALL invoke `ocr team resolve --json`
- **AND** the returned array SHALL be the source of truth for personas, instance counts, instance names, and per-instance model assignments

#### Scenario: Session-time override is respected

- **GIVEN** the user invokes a review with a session-level team override (via dashboard panel or `--team` CLI flag)
- **WHEN** the Tech Lead calls `ocr team resolve --json --session-override <override>`
- **THEN** the resolved composition SHALL reflect the override
- **AND** the override SHALL NOT be persisted to `.ocr/config.yaml`

---

### Requirement: Per-Instance Model Selection Honored on Capable Hosts

When the host AI CLI supports per-task model override (e.g. Claude Code subagent model frontmatter), Phase 4 SHALL pass each reviewer instance's `resolved_model` to the host's per-task primitive.

#### Scenario: Capable host honors per-instance models

- **GIVEN** a host CLI whose adapter reports `supportsPerTaskModel = true`
- **AND** a resolved team with two `principal` instances on different models
- **WHEN** Phase 4 spawns the reviewers
- **THEN** each instance SHALL be spawned with its assigned model
- **AND** each `agent_sessions` row SHALL record the actual `resolved_model` used

#### Scenario: Incapable host runs uniform parent model with warning

- **GIVEN** a host CLI whose adapter reports `supportsPerTaskModel = false`
- **AND** a resolved team that specifies different models per instance
- **WHEN** Phase 4 spawns the reviewers
- **THEN** all instances SHALL run on the parent process's model
- **AND** each `agent_sessions` row SHALL set `notes` to a structured warning indicating per-task model override is not supported on this host
- **AND** the warning SHALL be surfaced to the user in the final review output

---

### Requirement: Phase 4 Journals Each Instance via OCR

For every reviewer instance spawned in Phase 4, the Tech Lead SHALL record its lifecycle through the `ocr session` subcommand family.

#### Scenario: Instance start is journaled

- **GIVEN** a reviewer instance is about to be spawned
- **WHEN** the Tech Lead initiates the spawn
- **THEN** it SHALL first invoke `ocr session start-instance` with the workflow id, persona, instance index, name, vendor, and resolved model
- **AND** SHALL receive an `agent_sessions` id in return

#### Scenario: Vendor session id is bound when emitted

- **GIVEN** a spawned reviewer sub-agent emits its underlying CLI session id
- **WHEN** the Tech Lead observes the id
- **THEN** it SHALL invoke `ocr session bind-vendor-id <agent-id> <vendor-id>` exactly once

#### Scenario: Heartbeat is bumped between phases

- **GIVEN** a long-running reviewer instance is mid-review
- **WHEN** the Tech Lead progresses to a new sub-step or returns from a long tool call
- **THEN** it SHALL invoke `ocr session beat <agent-id>` to refresh `last_heartbeat_at`

#### Scenario: Instance end is journaled

- **GIVEN** a reviewer instance has completed (success, crash, or cancellation)
- **WHEN** the Tech Lead observes completion
- **THEN** it SHALL invoke `ocr session end-instance <agent-id>` with an appropriate exit code and optional note

---

### Requirement: OCR Does Not Own Phase 4 Process Spawning

The system SHALL NOT introduce a Phase 4 process orchestrator that spawns reviewer sub-agents from within OCR's own command-runner; sub-agent spawning remains the responsibility of the host AI CLI.

#### Scenario: command-runner does not fork per-reviewer adapters

- **GIVEN** a review enters Phase 4
- **WHEN** the dashboard's `command-runner.ts` orchestrates the review
- **THEN** it SHALL NOT fork one adapter process per reviewer instance
- **AND** the host AI CLI SHALL spawn sub-agents using its own per-task primitive
