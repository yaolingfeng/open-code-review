# review-map Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-review-map. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Map Architect Orchestration

The Map Architect workflow SHALL use graph context when available to guide topology analysis, flow tracing, dependency grouping, and review ordering. The git-derived canonical changed file list SHALL remain the completeness source of truth.

#### Scenario: Map uses graph topology

- **GIVEN** graph context exists for a map session
- **WHEN** topology and flow analysis run
- **THEN** Map Architect and Flow Analysts SHALL use graph-derived changed symbols, import, call, dependency, impact context, and changed-symbol precision signals to guide grouping and ordering
- **AND** topology analysis SHOULD prefer symbol-level changed nodes over file-level changed nodes when precision is available
- **AND** affected flows and test gaps SHOULD inform map synthesis priority notes
- **AND** all canonical changed files SHALL still appear in the final map

#### Scenario: Unsupported changed files in map

- **GIVEN** changed files include files unsupported by the graph engine
- **WHEN** map synthesis runs
- **THEN** unsupported changed files SHALL still appear in the map checklist
- **AND** the map MAY mark them as not covered by graph context

### Requirement: Flow Analyst Agents

The system SHALL spawn Flow Analyst agents with redundancy to trace upstream and downstream dependencies, identifying logical groupings and optimal review ordering.

#### Scenario: Flow tracing with redundancy
- **GIVEN** the Map Architect has established the canonical file list
- **WHEN** Flow Analysts are spawned
- **THEN** the system SHALL spawn 2 Flow Analyst instances by default
- **AND** each Flow Analyst SHALL independently:
  - Identify entry points (API endpoints, CLI commands, event handlers)
  - Trace downstream dependencies (what does each file call?)
  - Trace upstream dependencies (what calls each file?)
  - Group related files into logical flows
  - Propose section ordering

#### Scenario: Flow Analyst exploration
- **GIVEN** a Flow Analyst is analyzing the change set
- **WHEN** the analyst traces dependencies
- **THEN** the analyst SHALL have full agency to:
  - Read complete files beyond the diff
  - Examine import/export statements
  - Follow function calls across files
  - Check test files for coverage patterns
  - Document exploration rationale

---

### Requirement: Requirements Mapper Agent

The system SHALL provide a Requirements Mapper agent that maps changes to requirements/specs when requirements context is provided.

#### Scenario: Requirements mapping
- **GIVEN** user has provided requirements context
- **WHEN** the Requirements Mapper executes
- **THEN** the Requirements Mapper SHALL:
  - Analyze each changed file against stated requirements
  - Identify which requirements each file/section addresses
  - Flag changes that don't map to any stated requirement
  - Note requirements that appear unaddressed by the changes

#### Scenario: No requirements provided
- **GIVEN** user has not provided requirements context
- **WHEN** map workflow executes
- **THEN** the Requirements Mapper phase SHALL be skipped
- **AND** the map SHALL proceed without requirements annotations

---

### Requirement: Section-Based Map Structure

The system SHALL produce a review map organized into logical sections, each representing a cohesive flow or concern within the change set.

#### Scenario: Section organization
- **GIVEN** Flow Analysts have identified logical groupings
- **WHEN** the map is synthesized
- **THEN** each section SHALL contain:
  - Section name and purpose description
  - **Narrative ("The Story")** explaining what these changes accomplish
  - Key patterns or architectural approaches used
  - Requirements addressed (if requirements provided)
  - Ordered list of files with checkbox and brief description
  - Review notes (what to look for, connections to other sections)

#### Scenario: Section narrative content
- **GIVEN** a section is being synthesized
- **WHEN** the narrative is generated
- **THEN** the narrative SHALL:
  - Be framed as a **hypothesis** for the reviewer to verify
  - Explain what we INFER the grouped changes are trying to accomplish
  - Be written as a PR author might explain related changes
  - Connect to the overarching goal of the changeset
  - Reference previous sections when building on established context
  - Set up context for upcoming sections when relevant
  - Create a coherent story that flows through the entire map

#### Scenario: Explicit assumptions
- **GIVEN** a section narrative is generated
- **WHEN** inferences are made about intent or relationships
- **THEN** the section SHALL include an **Assumptions** list that:
  - Explicitly states each assumption the narrative is based on
  - Notes how the assumption was derived (e.g., "based on import analysis")
  - Provides verification points for the reviewer

#### Scenario: Section ordering
- **GIVEN** multiple sections exist in the map
- **WHEN** sections are ordered
- **THEN** sections SHALL be ordered by review priority:
  1. Entry points and public interfaces first
  2. Core implementation and business logic second
  3. Supporting utilities and helpers third
  4. Tests and documentation last
  5. **Unrelated Changes section always last**

---

### Requirement: Unrelated Changes Handling

The system SHALL identify and segregate changes that do not relate to the stated requirements, specifications, or other changes in the logical flow.

#### Scenario: Unrelated change detection
- **GIVEN** a change set is being analyzed
- **WHEN** a file does not relate to:
  - The stated requirements or specifications
  - Other changes in the changeset
  - Any identifiable logical flow
- **THEN** the file SHALL be flagged as potentially unrelated

#### Scenario: Unrelated changes section placement
- **GIVEN** unrelated changes have been identified
- **WHEN** the map is synthesized
- **THEN** the map SHALL include an "Unrelated Changes" section that:
  - Appears at the bottom of the map (after all flow-driven sections)
  - Explicitly notes why each file appears unrelated
  - Maintains the coherent narrative flow in the main sections above
  - Prompts the reviewer to verify whether the changes are:
    - Legitimate but unrelated cleanup/refactoring
    - Accidentally included in the changeset
    - Actually related in ways not detected

#### Scenario: No unrelated changes
- **GIVEN** all changes relate to requirements or logical flows
- **WHEN** the map is synthesized
- **THEN** the Unrelated Changes section MAY be omitted or marked as empty

---

### Requirement: Guaranteed File Completeness

The system SHALL guarantee that every changed file appears in the review map, using tool-call validation to prevent omissions.

#### Scenario: Completeness validation
- **GIVEN** the map synthesis phase begins
- **WHEN** the final map is generated
- **THEN** the system SHALL:
  - Compare all files in the map against the canonical file list
  - Fail synthesis if any file is missing
  - Report which files are missing in the error message

#### Scenario: File index generation
- **GIVEN** a complete map has been generated
- **WHEN** the map is finalized
- **THEN** the map SHALL include a File Index section with:
  - Alphabetical list of all changed files
  - Cross-reference to which section each file appears in
  - Checkbox for each file

---

### Requirement: Checkbox-Based Progress Tracking

The system SHALL format the review map with checkboxes to serve as a progress tracker for human reviewers.

#### Scenario: File-level checkboxes
- **GIVEN** a section lists files to review
- **WHEN** files are rendered in the map
- **THEN** each file SHALL be preceded by a markdown checkbox: `- [ ]`

#### Scenario: Section-level tracking
- **GIVEN** multiple sections exist
- **WHEN** the map is rendered
- **THEN** a summary checklist SHALL appear at the end:
  - `- [ ] Section 1: {name}` for each section
  - `- [ ] All files reviewed`
  - `- [ ] Understood overall approach`

---

### Requirement: Overview and Approach Summary

The system SHALL produce an executive summary at the beginning of the review map explaining the overarching approach taken in the change set.

#### Scenario: Overview content
- **GIVEN** the map synthesis phase executes
- **WHEN** the overview is generated
- **THEN** the overview SHALL include:
  - Brief description of what the PR/change set achieves
  - Key architectural decisions or patterns introduced
  - Notable trade-offs or design choices
  - Suggested focus areas for reviewers

#### Scenario: How to use section
- **GIVEN** a review map is generated
- **WHEN** the map is rendered
- **THEN** the map SHALL include a "How to Use This Map" section explaining:
  - The recommended review order
  - How sections relate to each other
  - What the checkboxes are for

---

### Requirement: Natural Language Activation

The system SHALL support natural language activation for review map generation.

#### Scenario: Natural language triggers
- **GIVEN** user sends a message
- **WHEN** message contains phrases like "map this PR", "create a review map", "help me review this", or "organize these changes"
- **THEN** the map workflow SHALL activate

---

### Requirement: Flexible Requirements Input

The system SHALL accept requirements context flexibly, using the same patterns as the review command.

#### Scenario: Requirements input methods
- **GIVEN** user wants to provide requirements context
- **WHEN** user provides context via:
  - Inline description in the map request
  - Reference to a document path
  - Pasted text
- **THEN** the Map Architect SHALL:
  - Recognize and capture the requirements
  - Pass them to the Requirements Mapper agent
  - Include requirements annotations in the final map

---

### Requirement: Shared Standards Discovery

The system SHALL use the **identical** standards discovery workflow as the review command, as defined in the `context-discovery` capability spec. This provides all agents with project standards, conventions, and high-level context.

#### Scenario: Unified standards discovery workflow
- **GIVEN** map or review command is initiated
- **WHEN** standards discovery phase executes
- **THEN** the system SHALL execute the **exact same** discovery algorithm:
  1. Read `.ocr/config.yaml` for project-specific context and rules (Priority 1)
  2. Pull OpenSpec context from `openspec/config.yaml` and specs (Priority 2)
  3. Discover reference files: AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, etc. (Priority 3)
  4. Load additional user-configured files (Priority 4)
  5. Merge all context with source attribution
  6. Save to `discovered-standards.md` in session directory

#### Scenario: Reuse existing session standards
- **GIVEN** a session already has `discovered-standards.md` from a prior map or review
- **WHEN** the other command runs in the same session
- **THEN** the system SHALL reuse the existing discovered standards (no re-discovery)

#### Scenario: Exhaustive standards coverage
- **GIVEN** standards discovery runs
- **WHEN** project standards are loaded
- **THEN** the discovery MUST be thorough and exhaustive:
  - Read ALL files in the configured discovery sources
  - Do NOT skip or summarize — include complete file contents
  - Preserve priority order for conflict resolution
  - Include OpenSpec specs for architectural context
  - Include active change proposals for awareness of in-flight work

---

### Requirement: Changeset Exploration (Map-Specific)

The map workflow SHALL perform multi-agent, multi-stage exploration of the changeset and surrounding implementation. This is distinct from standards discovery and is specific to the map workflow.

#### Scenario: Multi-agent exploration
- **GIVEN** standards have been discovered
- **WHEN** the map workflow proceeds to changeset exploration
- **THEN** the Map Architect SHALL coordinate multiple agents across multiple stages:
  1. **Topology Analysis** — Enumerate files, identify structure
  2. **Flow Tracing** — Flow Analysts trace dependencies (with redundancy)
  3. **Requirements Mapping** — Map changes to requirements (if provided)
  4. **Synthesis** — Combine findings into coherent map

#### Scenario: Upstream and downstream flow tracing
- **GIVEN** Flow Analysts are exploring the changeset
- **WHEN** agents trace dependencies
- **THEN** each agent SHALL:
  - Trace upstream implementation (what calls/uses the changed code)
  - Trace downstream implementation (what the changed code calls/uses)
  - Document the complete flow context for each change
  - Build understanding of where changes fit in the broader system

#### Scenario: Complete flow picture per change
- **GIVEN** an agent is analyzing a changed file
- **WHEN** the agent explores surrounding implementation
- **THEN** the agent SHALL investigate:
  - Direct callers of changed functions/classes
  - Direct callees of changed functions/classes
  - Related test files
  - Configuration that affects behavior
  - Sibling implementations (e.g., other handlers in the same router)

#### Scenario: Exploration depth
- **GIVEN** agents are exploring the codebase
- **WHEN** tracing dependencies
- **THEN** exploration MUST be deep enough to:
  - Understand the full flow a change participates in
  - Identify entry points that trigger the changed code
  - Identify downstream effects of the change
  - Support accurate section grouping and narrative generation
