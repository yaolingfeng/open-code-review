// ── Normalized Events ──
// All adapters parse their CLI's output format into these common events.
//
// The vocabulary is what the dashboard renders the live event stream from.
// Each event represents one observable thing the AI CLI did — emitted a
// chunk of message text, started thinking, called a tool, finished a tool,
// raised an error. Adapters DO NOT add execution/agent context — that is
// stamped on later by the command-runner when persisting + forwarding (see
// `StreamEvent`). Keeping adapters context-free makes them trivially
// testable and means new vendors only have to translate stdout.
//
// `tool_input_delta` was previously tunneled as a `tool_start` with magic
// name `__input_json_delta` — promoted here to a first-class variant.
//
// Sub-agent lifecycle (`agent_start`/`agent_end`) is deliberately NOT in
// this union. Sub-agents in OCR are journaled by the host AI calling
// `ocr session start-instance` / `end-instance` — they live in the
// `command_executions` table, not in the orchestrator's stdout stream.
// The client merges those rows with this event stream when rendering.
